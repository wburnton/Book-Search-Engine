## Description  

This deployed application uses the full MERN stack to create a book search engine using the google Books api. The application has been converted from a restful API to a apollo server GraphQL. As of now, viewing the saved books page is not functioning, but the rest is working fine.

## Usage  

On the deployed Heroku app, simply signup or login to create an account, and search books to save to your profile.
